# AI Visibility to Video Agent Feature Spec

## Document Purpose

This file defines the implementable scope for the secondary Peec + Hera project. Build this only after the main Context Surgeon demo is viable.

## Architecture

Recommended structure if built in same repo:

```text
apps/
  context-surgeon/
  ai-visibility-video-agent/
packages/
  provider-adapters/
  ui/
  demo-data/
docs/
  hackathon/
```

Lightweight alternative:

```text
side_projects/ai-visibility-video-agent/
  app/
  demo_data/
  README.md
```

Use the fastest stack already available from Context Surgeon.

## Data Models

```typescript
export type VisibilitySource = "peec" | "seeded";
export type GapType =
  | "missing_brand"
  | "competitor_dominates"
  | "negative_sentiment"

  | "wrong_positioning";

export interface BrandProject {
  id: string;

## Feature 1: Seeded Peec Opportunity Data

Goal:

Make the demo independent of live Peec access.

Acceptance criteria:

- App loads 3-5 opportunities from `demo_data/peec_opportunities.json`.
- Each opportunity has prompt, gap type, competitor mentions, cited sources, and reasoning.
- UI can switch between seeded and live adapter mode if live MCP is available.

Example seeded opportunities:

- Attio missing from "best CRM for agencies with custom onboarding workflows"
- Nothing Phone losing to Apple/Samsung for "best AI-native smartphone"
- BYD underrepresented for "best EV for European families"

## Feature 2: Opportunity Ranking

Goal:

Pick the best creative opportunity.

Scoring inputs:

- Gap type severity.
- Prompt intent.
- Competitor dominance.
- Availability of proof points.
- Brand fit.
- Video suitability.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each opportunity shows score and reason.
- Top opportunity can be selected automatically.
- User can override selection.

Simple scoring:

```typescript
score =
  intentScore * 0.3 +
  competitorGapScore * 0.25 +
  evidenceScore * 0.2 +
  videoPotentialScore * 0.15 +
  brandFitScore * 0.1
```

## Feature 3: Tavily Source Evidence

Goal:
